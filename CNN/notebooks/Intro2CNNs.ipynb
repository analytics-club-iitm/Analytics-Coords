    "Usually, when we calculate backpropagation for a particular layer in a deep neural network, we estimate that the weights in the previous layers more or less do not change when we calculate gradients. However, this is not the case in reality and all the layers' weights are updated simultaneously in backprogation. The result of this is that the update procedure is endlessly chasing a moving target, so to speak. <br>\n",
    "To solve this issue, we implement a technique called batch normalisation (batchnorm for short). Here, the outputs of each layer (before or after activation, depending on the function) in a mini-batch are standardized by using their mean and standard deviation. This results in an increased training efficiency and also provides a regularization effect."

    "2. Transitional invariance; basically, if the image is shifted a bit with respect to the original image, the network will not have any trouble identifying it as the original image.\n",
    "3. Lower number of parameters to be learned; here, the parameters for a convolutional layer are the elements of the filter used; pooling layers have no parameters to be learned at all.\n",

Transfer learning; let us go back to this image from the hierarchial representation section.<br> ![image hierarchy](https://miro.medium.com/max/3820/1*fLGuAUT5imTIGAeA4zzaWA.png)<br> As can be seen here, the lower level features of the different types of images are all the same. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the weights learned for these filters in one task can be carried over to be used in other tasks - and this assumption is proven correct. We sometimes use pretrained models for the lower levels of the hierarchy in images and only train the model for the problem-specific layers that will differ from case to case. This process is called transfer learning."
